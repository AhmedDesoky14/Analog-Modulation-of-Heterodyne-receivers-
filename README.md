# Analog Modulation Simulation for Heterodyne Receivers

This MATLAB project simulates the process of analog modulation in heterodyne receivers, a fundamental concept in communication systems. The simulation demonstrates how signals are modulated, downconverted, and processed to extract the original information, providing insights into the behavior and advantages of heterodyne receivers.
